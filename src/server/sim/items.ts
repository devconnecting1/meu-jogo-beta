/*
 * Ground items and building loot, decided by the SERVER (docs/MULTIPLAYER.md §2.1, §4.5, §8.1, §8.3).
 *
 * What was wrong. Every client rolled its own loot, spawned its own drops and picked them up into its own
 * copy of the save. Two survivors searching the same house each walked out with a different armful, because
 * there were two houses; a dropped rifle existed for whoever dropped it and for nobody else; and "pick up"
 * was a local `addItem`, which is to say: free items for anyone willing to edit their client.
 *
 * What is true now:
 *   - ONE set of items, with server-issued dynamic ids (§4.5), replicated as ItemAdd/ItemRemove within
 *     ITEM_INTEREST. The mutation hooks live on `WorldData` itself, so a zombie's death drop deep inside
 *     shared/sim/ai/zombieBrain.ts replicates without that file knowing this one exists.
 *   - PICKUP is a request, resolved at the server's position of the survivor, and it is atomic: the world's
 *     `removeGroundItem` is the arbiter, so of two survivors reaching for the same can in the same tick, one
 *     gets a can and the other gets nothing (§8.3 "checar + mutar sem yield no meio"). That is the §11.3 F3
 *     acceptance line, and it is the same line that makes duplication impossible: an item can only pay out
 *     once because it can only be removed once.
 *   - LOOT of a building is rolled once, by the server, and the CONTENT never travels (§4.3). What the
 *     client learns is a flag — "there is something here" — and only while standing inside. The first valid
 *     `search` takes everything; the second is told the building is empty, which is what it is.
 *
 * The roll itself is the original's, moved verbatim from client/systems/interaction.ts, with one fix: the
 * "probability of exactly one" branch used raw `math.random()` while everything around it used the shared
 * rng. On a server that has to be replayable in Node (tools/) that is not a style question.
 *
 * Pure module: no Instances, no services, no os.clock. Time comes in as game hours, like the original.
